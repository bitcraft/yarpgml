    WHEN PLAYER TALKS TO KING LORIC: >
      KING LORIC
        Descendant of Erdrick, listen now to my words.

        It is told that in ages past Erdrick fought demons with a Ball of
        Light. Then came the Dragonlord who stole the precious globe and hid
        it in the darkness.

        Now, <player name>, thou must help us recover the Ball of Light and
        restore peace to our land.

        The Dragonlord must be defeated.

        Take now whatever thou may find in these Treasure Chests to aid thee
        in thy quest.

        Then speak with the guards, for they have much knowledge that may aid
        thee. May the light shine upon thee, <player name>.

    WHEN PLAYER OPENS CHEST 1: >
      give player 120 gold

    WHEN PLAYER OPENS CHEST 2: >
      give player 1 torch

    WHEN PLAYER OPENS CHEST 3: >
