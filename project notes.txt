containers: >
  containers are allowed to "contain" other objects.
  in a reality, we define "containing" as a variety
  of descriptions, but mostly that the item being
  contained cannot escape from the dimensions/walls
  of the container.  for the game, we do not model
  the physical objects, so we have an abstraction of
  containers, where the "contained" objects are related
  through a list.  items cannot be contained by multiple
  objects.  it cannot be contained by nothing.  it must
  have a container, and that container may be a npc,
  chest, or map.
